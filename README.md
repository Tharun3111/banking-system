# Banking System Web Application



## Description

This repository contains the code for a web-based banking system. The application allows users to view customer details and perform fund transfers between accounts.
During my internship with The Sparks Foundation, I successfully developed a comprehensive banking system that utilizes fundamental front-end and back-end technologies. The primary objective of this project was to implement a system that could efficiently record and manage the credit and debit transactions of users while updating their current account balances.

Key Features:

- User Transactions: The system allows users to perform credit and debit transactions seamlessly, ensuring accurate and up-to-date records of their financial activities.

- Balance Updates: Real-time updates are made to the user's account balance after each transaction, ensuring accurate and current financial information.

- User-Friendly Interface: The front-end of the system is designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and perform banking operations efficiently.

Technologies Used:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: PHP
- Database: MySQL
Throughout the internship, I gained valuable insights into web development and database management while honing my skills in front-end and back-end technologies. The experience has been instrumental in enhancing my proficiency as a developer and has provided me with a practical understanding of building secure and efficient banking applications.

I am proud to have contributed to this project and look forward to leveraging my learnings to take on more challenging tasks in the future.
